# batch_match
Move batches of files to a new directory.

The program should be interacted with through a command line interface in a Linux style. The program should gain as input a source directory and a filetype (.mp4, .mkv, .mp3, etc) and recursively scan through the all sub directories and then move files of the specified filetypes to the specified location.

The primary motivation for writing this program is to minimize tedious 'manual' labor. 

A potential usecase for the program, could be in a situation where one has (legally!) downloaded several files of different formats. These files need to go somewhere else but simply going through all the subfolders and then dragging&dropping files from source to destination directory is dumb. Enter batch_match; simply specify destination plus filetype and the rest will be handled for you!

Technology:
Will probably write this in Python...
